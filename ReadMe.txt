Hey Ben

This USB stick should make updating your Jinn much easier. If anything goes wrong Hes or I "should" be able to use it to help you.

It downloads the latest copy of Jinn from your internet computer and then automatically updates your non-internet PC. The steps you need to follow are listed below.

ON YOUR INTERNET PC:

1. On your internet connected computer plug in this USB stick and then double click the "Jinn downloader" shortcut.
	-This will open the Jinn Downloader window
2. Click 'Download' on the bottom left
	-This may take a couple minutes depending on how fast your internet is
	-For me it takes around 2-3 minutes
3. Wait for the downloader to say it is finished
4. Close the downloader and remove the USB stick and plug it into your offline work computer

ON YOUR OFFLINE PC:

5. Plug in the USB stick and double click the "Jinn updater" shortcut
	-This will open the Jinn Updater window
6. Click 'Update' on the bottom left
	-This may take upto a minute to finish
7. Wait for the "Finished" message
8. Close the Updater and remove the memory stick


Your Jinn should now be upto date, if anything goes wrong contact Hez or me.

Thanks,
Laurence Leo
